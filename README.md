# HF-Bio-CinicalBERT-Integration

This is an example of integrating the Hugging Face Transformers library with ipywidgets to create an interactive
interface for analyzing health data using a pre-trained clinical BERT model. This is to
give a demonstration of how to use the Hugging Face Transformers library in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

This template could be used to integrate with other publicly available models or custom models for various NLP
tasks using the BERT transformers in the Clinical or HealthCare domain.
